# github-automation-committer

Small script to automate commits to GitHub from a pipeline/workflow using Docker container as a step.

Supports dynamic branch creation and opening of pull requests against target branch.

WIP - Possibly moving to Codefresh Argo Hub as Workflow Template in near future.
